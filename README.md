This is a simple AutoHotkey V2 script that I made, which _has changed the way I use computers_.
It's not a superficial statement. I find it strange to use a PC without it.

The core of the script is navigation with the left hand, enabling you to do more without moving your hands away from the keyboard and keeping your right hand as free as possible. This is done by remapping the Caps Lock key to function as a _modifier_.


**How to use it:**
- Download and install AutoHotkey (V2 or higher): https://www.autohotkey.com
- Clone or download as .zip this repository
- Open `shell:startup` folder (you can do it from `Win+R` to open Run window, or by typing it in the address bar of a explorer window), and place there the `script.ahk` file you downloaded from this repository. You can place it anywhere else, but in this location the script will run automatically when you start your system.
- Double click the `script.ahk` file to run the script. Done!


**Notes:**
- I use a laptop with a US keyboard and a custom MSKLC soft keyboard, so some parts of the script might not make sense for you. Adapt it to your needs.
- I know very little about AutoHotkey, so many things could be improved. If you see something that could be fixed or changed, please tell me!
- **Sometimes the script turns off/on by itself**; I don't know the reason yet. I usually solve it by pressing the Caps Lock key again or turning the script off/on (Capslock + Esc). If you know how to solve it, Iâ€™d appreciate it if you could let me know.
- Any suggestions and ideas are more than welcome!
