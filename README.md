This is a simple `AutoHotkey V2` script that I made, which has changed the way I use computers. It's not a superficial statement.

The heart of the script is navigation with the left hand, allowing you to do much more without moving your hands away from the keyboard. This is done by remapping the Caps Lock key to function as a modifier.

I can't go back to the way I used computers before. In fact, I find it strange to use a PC without this script! You can try it yourself for a few days, and you'll be amazed at how much you can do now without changing hand positions. Your right hand will be a lot freer for other tasks.

**Some notes:**

- I use a laptop with a US keyboard and a custom MSKLC soft keyboard, so some parts of the script might not make sense for you. Adapt it to your needs.
- I know very little about AutoHotkey, so many things could be improved. If you see something that could be fixed or changed, please tell me!
- Sometimes the script turns off/on by itself; I don't know the reason yet. I usually solve it by pressing the Caps Lock key or turning the script off/on (Caps Lock + Esc).
