This is a simple `AutoHotkey V2` script that I made, which _has changed the way I use computers_.
It's not a superficial statement.

The heart of the script is navigation with the left hand, allowing you to do much more without moving your hands away from the keyboard. This is done by remapping the Caps Lock key to function as a _modifier_.

I find it strange to use a PC without this script.

**Notes:**

- I use a laptop with a US keyboard and a custom MSKLC soft keyboard, so some parts of the script might not make sense for you. Adapt it to your needs.
- I know very little about AutoHotkey, so many things could be improved. If you see something that could be fixed or changed, please tell me!
- Sometimes the script turns off/on by itself; I don't know the reason yet. I usually solve it by pressing the Caps Lock key again or turning the script off/on (Capslock + Esc).
